Many websites that offer serial or product keys for various software are not ranked highly by search engines, because they may be illegal or unreliable. However, they can still appear on google if you know how to search for them. In this google database searching trick, I will show you a specific search technique that can help you find a serial or product key of any software for free.

The first step is to open google and type in the name of the software you want to find a serial or product key for. For example, if you want to find a key for Adobe Photoshop, you would type in "Adobe Photoshop" in the search box.
  
The next step is to add some special operators and keywords to your query. These operators and keywords will help you narrow down your search results to only show websites that have serial or product keys for your software. The operators and keywords are:
  
- **inurl:** This operator will only show websites that have a certain word or phrase in their URL. For example, if you type in "inurl:serial", you will only see websites that have the word "serial" in their URL.
- **intitle:** This operator will only show websites that have a certain word or phrase in their title. For example, if you type in "intitle:keygen", you will only see websites that have the word "keygen" in their title.
- **-** This operator will exclude websites that have a certain word or phrase from your search results. For example, if you type in "-youtube", you will not see any websites that have the word "youtube" in them.
- **" "** This operator will only show websites that have an exact match of the word or phrase inside the quotation marks. For example, if you type in ""Adobe Photoshop CS6"", you will only see websites that have the exact phrase "Adobe Photoshop CS6" in them.

The final step is to combine these operators and keywords in your query to find the best results. You can use any combination of these operators and keywords, but here is a general formula that works well:
  
`software name + inurl:serial OR key OR keygen OR crack -youtube -facebook -twitter -pinterest -amazon -ebay`
  
This formula will show you websites that have serial or product keys for your software, and exclude websites that are likely to be irrelevant or untrustworthy. For example, if you want to find a key for Adobe Photoshop CS6, you would type in:
  
`Adobe Photoshop CS6 + inurl:serial OR key OR keygen OR crack -youtube -facebook -twitter -pinterest -amazon -ebay`
  
This will give you a list of websites that may have what you are looking for. You can then visit these websites and try to find the serial or product key for your software. Be careful though, as some of these websites may contain viruses or malware, so make sure you have a good antivirus program installed on your computer before downloading anything.
